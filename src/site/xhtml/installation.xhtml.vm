	<h1>Installation</h1>

	<h2>Compatibility</h2>
	This authentication plugin will work with an ICAT version of 4.9.0 or
	greater.

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The authn.ldap distribution: <a
			href="${repoUrl}/org/icatproject/authn.ldap/${project.version}/authn.ldap-${project.version}-distro.zip">authn.ldap-${project.version}-distro.zip</a>
		</li>
		<li>A suitable deployed container (here assumed to be
			Payara/Glassfish) to support a web application. Testing has been
			carried out with payara41. <a
			href="http://icatproject.org/installation/glassfish/">Payara/Glassfish
				installation instructions</a> are available.
		</li>
		<li>Python (version 2.4 to 2.7) installed on the server.</li>
		<li>If you wish to connect to the ldap server with SASL i.e. a
			url starting ldaps: rather than ldap: then you may need to store a
			certificate to say that you trust the ldap server. If this is
			necessary then, in the case of Payara/Glassfish, it should be added
			to keystore.jks in the config directory of the domain you are using
			and the domain stopped and started again.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Summary of steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Please follow <a
			href="http://icatproject.org/installation/component/"> the
				generic installation instructions</a>
		</li>
		<li>If you are introducing the ldap authenticator then update
			the run.properties file for icat.server to see the authenticator and
			restart icat to see the change. The easiest way is to rerun the setup
			script for the icat.server. <em>Remember that restful
				authenticators are identified by url rather than jndi.</em>
		</li>
		<li>Check that it works.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>The setup.properties file</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>container</dt>
		<dd>
			Values must be chosen from: <a target="_blank"
				href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/api/2.6/org/eclipse/persistence/config/TargetServer.html">TargetServer</a>
			Though only Glassfish is working properly at the moment.
		</dd>
		<dt>home</dt>
		<dd>is the top level of the container installation. For Glassfish
			it must contain "glassfish/domains" and for JBoss (wildfly) it must
			contain jboss-modules.jar.</dd>
		<dt>port</dt>
		<dd>is the administration port of the container which is
			typically 4848 for Glassfish and 9990 for JBoss.</dd>
		<dt>secure</dt>
		<dd>must be set to true or false. If true then only https and not
			http connections will be allowed.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>The logback.xml file</h2>
	<p>If you wish to modify the provided logging levels then rename
		logback.xml.example to logback.xml and edit it to suit your needs.</p>

	<h2>The run.properties file</h2>
	<p>This file configures from where calls may be made, properties to
		pass to the ldap server and mappings to perform on the provided user
		name to get the returned value.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>provider_url</dt>
		<dd>Space separated list of ldap url values. Each must start with
			ldap or ldaps.</dd>

		<dt>security_principal</dt>
		<dd>The % character in the security_principal will be replaced by
			the specified user name. If you just use % then the user must enter a
			complete security_principal as his user name.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h4>Control of IP address from which a call is allowed</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt>ip</dt>
		<dd>If access to the LDAP authentication should only be allowed
			from certain IP addresses then provide a space separated list of
			allowed values. These take the form of an IPV4 or IPV6 address
			followed by the number of bits (starting from the most significant)
			to consider.</dd>

	</dl>

	<h4>Overriding or supplementing key value pairs in the LDAP
		context.</h4>
	<p>This is to cater for possibilities not otherwise covered</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>context.props</dt>
		<dd>an optional space separated list of keys to be added to or
			overridden in the ldap context</dd>

		<dt>context.props.&lt;key&gt;</dt>
		<dd>
			the value for the specified key. For example you might have:

			<blockquote>
				<code>
					context.props = java.naming.factory.initial
					java.naming.security.authentication <br />
					context.props.java.naming.factory.initial =
					com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory <br />
					context.props.java.naming.security.authentication = simple <br />
				</code>
			</blockquote>

			which are actually the default values.

		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h4>ldap mapping</h4>
	<p>It is possible to specify a query which will map the user name
		provided onto a new name. This is controlled by the three properties
		listed below. If one is present they must all be present. For example:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<code>
			ldap.base = DC=fed,DC=cclrc,DC=ac,DC=uk <br /> ldap.filter =
			(&amp;(CN=%)(objectclass=user)) <br /> ldap.attribute = name
		</code>
	</blockquote>

	will work at RAL to replace the user name identified by the CN value
	with that held in the name attribute.

	<dl>

		<dt>ldap.base</dt>
		<dd>the base for the search</dd>
		<dt>ldap.filter</dt>
		<dd>an LDAP filter which should return one result - the first one
			returned is used</dd>

		<dt>ldap.attribute</dt>
		<dd>the attribute name to use</dd>
	</dl>


	<h4>Control of case of returned name</h4>
	In addition to the ability to use an ldap search to map the name you
	can simple specify case = upper or case = lower to simply convert the
	case. This is applied after the ldap mapping described above.
	<dl>

		<dt>case</dt>
		<dd>optional case specification - if specified must be "upper" or
			"lower".</dd>
	</dl>

	<h4>Control of mechanism part of the returned name</h4>
	<dl>

		<dt>mechanism</dt>
		<dd>if specified is a label to appear before the user name as it
			is made available to ICAT for authorization. For example if this is
			set to 'ldap' then the user 'root' will be provided to ICAT as
			'ldap/root', but if no mechanism is specified it will be provided
			simply as 'root'.</dd>
	</dl>


	<h2>Update the icat.properties file for your ICAT</h2>
	<p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator if this
		is the first time that a RestFul (2.0.0 and greater) LDAP
		authenticator has been used by the icat.server.</p>
	<p>
		Go to the installation directory for icat.server then edit the
		run.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
		<kbd> ./setup install </kbd>
	</p>


	<h2>Check that authn.ldap works</h2>
	<p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) with valid ldap
		credentials. It should report that it logs in but may or may not have
		the permission to run the rest of the test. If it does not report that
		it has logged in then please check the server.log and the
		authn_ldap.log files which can both be found in the logs directory.</p>

	A simple standalone test is to run:
	<blockquote>
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/authn.ldap/description -w
			"\n"</code>
		which returns a description, <br />
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/authn.ldap/version -w "\n"</code>
		which returns the version and<br />
		<code>curl -k https://localhost:8181/authn.ldap/authenticate -w
			"\n" -d
			'json={"credentials":[{"username":"&lt;username&gt;"},{"password":"&lt;secret&gt;"}]}'</code>
		to authenticate.
	</blockquote>
